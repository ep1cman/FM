PCB Stencil Laser Cutting 06/03/2015

First materiel was clear mylar 0.125mm thickness.

First attempts using two layers, bottom layer to hold/remove the cutouts from the top layer. Attempted 4 different powers around 7% - mylar at this thickness and pin pitch is a bit too delicate to survive the peeling process of removing the cutouts/bottom layer.

Second materiel was self adhesive kapton tape stuck on a glass sheet. At this thickness it ripped whilst trying to remove from the glass pane, also a slightly burny cut.

Third attempt was single layer mylar at 7% power. Cut much better, but left "tags" in the corners wihch were hard to remove.

Fourth attempt single layer mylar with sellotape underneath the cut at 7.5%. Peeling sellotape off the back removed the cutouts extremely well, but there wa ssome slight melting at the fine pitch PIC pins.

Fifth attempt with single layer mylar with self adhesive kapton tape for cutout removal (used because it was wider than the sticky tape). 7.25% power. Left large amount of burning residue on mylar, kapton absorbed a lot of heat and a couple of holes didn't fully cut. 

Sixth attempt with single layer mylar, sellotape, 7.25% power single pass. Comes out pretty well with minimal hanging cutouts in the PIC pins, which are very fixable under a microscope with fine pitch tweezers.

Seventh attempts by using raster images and engraving it off, but heat warped the mylar and became useless for stencil. 

Eighth attempt, 7% power, 0.25% speed, 20,000hz, 3 passes on single layer mylar with sellotape backing. A bit all over the place, melting some and not cutting fully others.
