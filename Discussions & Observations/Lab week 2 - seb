The PICkit 3 refused to enable its power supply.
 - Switching to MPLAB IPE and enabling it fixed it
 - Switching back to MPLAB IDE and it works now

The debug express board lacks a pull up resistor or MCLR
 - A 10K was added to solve this

PICs only have pullups on PORTB
 - They are set using the WPUB register
 - bit 7 in INTCON2 then needs to be cleared to update the pullups
