Latest MPLABX (v3 BETA) and XC8 (v1.34) do not fix it
(although mplab v3 has native git support)

issue persists in linux too

i can confirm the issue is arising from the setBit function being called in the tune function
you have to close and reopen mplab to clear the error

its the WriteRegister function in setbit thats causing it (oddly the one in initAR1010 isnt causing an issue)

fter removing all the code and adding in part by part what was necessary for it to work i discovered everything was fine.
Only part left was volume. 
uncommenting the volume arrays causes the error to return

CAUSE:
There is a bug in the complier meaning it is unable to make arrays of unsigned chars. The following code will trigger it:

unsigned char bugHere[1] = {0xF};

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    return (1);
}

SOLUTION:
Since we dont actually need to change the values we can make the array const and this fixes the issue
