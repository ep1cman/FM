Super Awesome FM Project Team Meeting Minutes
---------------------------------------------

Present: Seb, Stuart, Phil
Random AC03 Room. 


Decided to implement alphanumeric display first cuz that will hopefully lead to us only having to code for one display. 

PCB + stencil/reflow soldering plan confirmed with everyone.

Check with John about reflow oven. Check with Julian about vinyl + laser cutter pitch.

Agreed re adding stereo speakers and replacing front panel/casing sides with laser cut acrylic. 


Hardware block diagram agreed. 

Week by week time plan agreed.

First hour of week 2 everyone to  work on testing volume control with amp. 

Does PIC RTC need an external xtal? 
Answer: YES but would need an battery backup powering the whole PIC.
        Use I2C RTC module instead: DS3231

HARDWARE DEBOUNCE!!
